# Financial Fraud Detection & Explainability

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning to detect financial fraud using two real-world datasets. We compare Logistic Regression and XGBoost, and interpret our best model with SHAP.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Raw datas
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each major task
- `models/`: Trained model artifacts
- `artifacts/`: Data splits
- `results/`: SHAP visualizations
- `results/`: Evaluation metrics


## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-shap.git
cd fraud-detection-shap
